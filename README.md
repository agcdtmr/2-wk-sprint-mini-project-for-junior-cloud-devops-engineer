# One-week sprint project for a Junior Cloud DevOps Engineer

Here's a simple project outline with tips and instructions:

### Project: Deploy a Basic Web Application on AWS using Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

#### Day 1: Planning and Setup
- **Goal:** Understand project requirements and set up the development environment.
- **Tasks:**
  - Define the scope: Decide on the type of web application (e.g., simple static website, microservice) to deploy.
  - Set up AWS Free Tier account if not already done.
  - Install necessary tools (AWS CLI, Git, Terraform, or AWS CloudFormation).
  - Create a GitHub repository for version control.

#### Day 2-3: Infrastructure Setup
- **Goal:** Create infrastructure required to host the web application using IaC.
- **Tasks:**
  - Choose IaC tool (Terraform, AWS CloudFormation).
  - Write code/scripts to create infrastructure components (VPC, EC2 instance, Load Balancer, etc.) as code.
  - Test the IaC scripts locally.
  - Deploy infrastructure on AWS.

#### Day 4-5: Application Deployment
- **Goal:** Deploy the web application on the infrastructure created.
- **Tasks:**
  - Prepare the web application code (if not provided) or use a simple sample application.
  - Configure the deployment process (e.g., Dockerize the app, set up CI/CD pipelines).
  - Deploy the application on the infrastructure.
  - Test the deployed application to ensure it's accessible and functional.

#### Day 6-7: Monitoring and Documentation
- **Goal:** Implement basic monitoring and document the project.
- **Tasks:**
  - Set up basic monitoring and logging (CloudWatch, CloudTrail, or similar services).
  - Create documentation detailing the project setup, deployment process, and any troubleshooting steps.
  - Prepare a brief presentation or report summarizing the project and learnings.

#### Tips and Instructions for a Junior DevOps Engineer:
1. **Focus on Learning:** This project is primarily for learning. Don't worry about perfection; focus on understanding concepts and best practices.
2. **Use AWS Free Tier:** Stick to services covered under the AWS Free Tier to avoid unnecessary costs.
3. **Modularize IaC Code:** Break down the infrastructure code into reusable modules for scalability and maintainability.
4. **Follow Best Practices:** Research and follow best practices for security, cost optimization, and performance.
5. **Ask for Help:** Donâ€™t hesitate to seek guidance from seniors or online resources when stuck.

Remember, the goal is **not just** to complete the project but to understand the concepts and processes involved in deploying applications on the cloud using IaC. Good luck, and enjoy the learning process!
