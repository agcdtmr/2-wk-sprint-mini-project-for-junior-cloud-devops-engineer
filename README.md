#### Tips for a Junior DevOps Engineer:

- **Start Simple:** Begin with a basic project setup and gradually add complexity. Don't try to incorporate advanced features at the beginning.
- **Documentation Is Key:** Keep detailed notes throughout the project. This will help you understand your own process and make troubleshooting easier.
- **Use Online Resources:** Leverage AWS and Terraform documentation, tutorials, and forums. Don't hesitate to seek help from communities if you're stuck.
- **Regular Commits:** Commit your changes frequently and write meaningful commit messages. This helps in tracking changes and debugging.
- **Test Thoroughly:** Ensure your CI/CD pipeline includes proper testing phases. This practice enhances the reliability of your deployments.

Remember, this plan is flexible and might need adjustments based on your progress and familiarity with the tools. Good luck with your project!

## Understanding the project requirements and scope

Understanding the project requirements and scope means figuring out exactly **what you need to do** and **what your project will involve**.


**Project Goal (The main aim is to):**
1. create a basic API (a way for different software programs to talk to each other)
2. deploy the basic API on Amazon Web Services (AWS)
3. use Terraform for setting up infrastructure
4. GitLab CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment - a way to automate testing and deploying code).

**Key Questions to Answer:**
1. What does the API need to do? (e.g., handle certain types of data, perform specific tasks)
   - Use Python to make a GET request to an API using the popular requests library
   - The API needs to handle user authentication
   - Perform CRUD operations.
3. Which AWS services will you use? (e.g., EC2 for hosting, maybe others for databases or storage, Deploying a basic API on AWS can be done using various services, but one common approach is to use AWS Lambda for the code execution and API Gateway to manage the API endpoints)
   - AWS Lambda for code execution, API Gateway for managing API endpoints, and Amazon RDS for database storage.
4. How will you set up the infrastructure using Terraform? (e.g., networks, servers)
  - Set up VPC, subnets, security groups, Lambda function configuration, API Gateway, and IAM roles using Terraform.
5. What steps are required to automate testing and deployment using GitLab CI/CD? (e.g., writing scripts, setting up pipelines)
  - Write test scripts for API endpoints, set up GitLab pipelines for automated testing (unit, integration) and deployment to AWS.

**Scope: Define the boundaries of your project. For example:**
1. Which parts of AWS will you use? (Avoid making it too complex at first)
  - Utilize AWS Lambda and API Gateway
2. What level of complexity will your API have? (Start with a simple one and maybe add features later)
  - Begin with a simple API 
3. What specific tasks will you perform with Terraform and GitLab CI/CD? (Setting up infrastructure, automating testing and deployment)
- Terraform: Network and server setup; GitLab CI/CD: Automation of testing and deployment

**Constraints and Resources: Consider any limitations or resources available to you:**
1. Time: One week to complete this project.
2. Skills: What do you already know? What might you need to learn?
  - Knowledge in Python to build API
  - Learn how to use AWS Lambda and API Gateway
  - Learn how to code AWS infrastracture using Terraform 
3. Tools: Are there any specific versions or tools you're required to use?
