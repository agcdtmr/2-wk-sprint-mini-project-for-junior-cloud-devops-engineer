|             | - Test manually to ensure the deployed infrastructure is functional                             |
| **Day 4**   | **Code API and Set Up GitLab CI/CD Pipeline**                                                  |
|             | - Develop a simple API using a language/framework of your choice                                 |

#### Tips for a Junior DevOps Engineer:

- **Start Simple:** Begin with a basic project setup and gradually add complexity. Don't try to incorporate advanced features at the beginning.
- **Documentation Is Key:** Keep detailed notes throughout the project. This will help you understand your own process and make troubleshooting easier.
- **Use Online Resources:** Leverage AWS and Terraform documentation, tutorials, and forums. Don't hesitate to seek help from communities if you're stuck.
- **Regular Commits:** Commit your changes frequently and write meaningful commit messages. This helps in tracking changes and debugging.
- **Test Thoroughly:** Ensure your CI/CD pipeline includes proper testing phases. This practice enhances the reliability of your deployments.

Remember, this plan is flexible and might need adjustments based on your progress and familiarity with the tools. Good luck with your project!

## Understanding the project requirements and scope

Understanding the project requirements and scope means figuring out exactly **what you need to do** and **what your project will involve**.


Project Goal (The main aim is to):  
1. create a basic API (a way for different software programs to talk to each other)
2. deploy the basicAPI on Amazon Web Services (AWS), using Terraform (a tool for setting up infrastructure) and GitLab CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment - a way to automate testing and deploying code).
